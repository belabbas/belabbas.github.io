My research interests are in control theory and dynamical systems. I focus on geometric and stochastic control, with their applications to networked systems, formation control, sensor and actuator design, motion planning, robotics and learning. I am also interested in (random) graph theoretic methods in control, and particularly in graphon-based approaches.
